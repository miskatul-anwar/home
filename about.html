                <p>
                    Growing up in Bangladesh, I was the kind of kid who would disassemble
                    anything with a circuit board just to see how it worked — and
                    occasionally manage to put it back together. My earliest memories with
                    computers involved endlessly tweaking desktop themes, writing tiny batch
                    scripts that did absolutely nothing useful, and convincing myself that
                    changing the wallpaper counted as "hacking." That sense of curiosity
                    never really faded; it just found better outlets.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm <strong>Miskatul Anwar</strong>, currently pursuing my undergraduate
                    degree at the <strong>Department of Computer Science and Engineering</strong>
                    at the <strong>University of Chittagong</strong>. Alongside my studies, I
                    work as a research assistant at
                    <a href="https://bike-csecu.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIKE Labs CSECU</a>
                    (Big Data Knowledge Engineering), where I get to explore the intersection
                    of large-scale data systems and intelligent computing — the kind of work
                    that makes you forget what time it is until the call to prayer reminds you.
                </p>

                <h2>Languages &amp; Low-Level Fascination</h2>

                <p>
                    I fell in love with <strong>Rust</strong> the way most people fall in love
                    with bad ideas — completely and without warning. There's something
                    deeply satisfying about a language that refuses to compile until you've
                    genuinely understood your own code. My
                    <code>RustaceanUp</code> repository is essentially a journal of that
                    obsession: convex hull algorithms, Mandelbrot set renderers, async
                    runtimes, and a mini-grep that I'm unreasonably proud of. Before Rust,
                    <strong>Python</strong> was my daily driver — from Flask web apps and
                    Pygame platformers to quick-and-dirty automation scripts that saved me
                    hours of tedious work. I've also spent a fair amount of time with
                    <strong>C/C++</strong>, <strong>Shell scripting</strong>, and even
                    <strong>Assembly</strong> — because sometimes you need to understand what
                    the machine is actually doing underneath all the abstractions.
                </p>

                <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>

                <p>
                    I'm an active competitive programmer on
                    <strong>Codeforces</strong> (handle: <code>miskatul.anwar.csecu</code>),
                    where I've achieved an <strong>Expert</strong> rating of
                    <strong>1785</strong> and solved over <strong>248 problems</strong>. I've
                    participated in team contests on Kattis and spent countless late nights
                    grinding through combinatorics, number theory, and graph problems. There's
                    a peculiar kind of joy in reducing a seemingly impossible problem to an
                    elegant thirty-line solution at 3 AM — followed by the immediate
                    realization that you have a class in four hours.
                </p>

                <h2>Systems, Security &amp; Tinkering</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Linux</strong> is home. I've been a daily driver for years, and
                    my dotfiles are probably more carefully curated than my wardrobe. I'm
                    deeply interested in <strong>penetration testing</strong> and
                    cybersecurity — the kind of work where you get to think like an
                    adversary and then build defenses against yourself. I've been steadily
                    learning <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>Apache2</strong>, and
                    <strong>Nginx</strong> to better understand how production systems are
                    deployed and, more interestingly, how they break. I also dabble in
                    <strong>picoCTF</strong> challenges for fun — there's always another flag
                    hiding somewhere.
                </p>

                <h2>Machine Learning &amp; Research</h2>

                <p>
                    My work at BIKE Labs has drawn me into the world of
                    <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>big data engineering</strong>.
                    I work primarily with <strong>PyTorch</strong> and <strong>CUDA</strong>,
                    building and training models that can find patterns in datasets far too
                    large for any human to parse by hand. There's a philosophical edge to ML
                    that I find fascinating — the idea that you can teach a mathematical
                    function to "understand" something, even if that understanding is
                    fundamentally different from our own.
                </p>

                <h2>Beyond the Terminal</h2>

                <p>
                    When I'm not staring at a terminal, I enjoy getting lost in a good anime
                    (the username <em>Ghost</em> and the Geass icon probably gave that away),
                    exploring obscure corners of the internet for fun trivia — did you know
                    the Night's Watch cloaks in Game of Thrones were made from IKEA rugs? — and
                    occasionally attempting to build small games just to see if I can. I
                    believe the best engineers are the ones who never quite stopped being
                    curious kids, and I try to carry that energy into everything I do.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If any of this resonates, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to
                    talk about Rust, competitive programming, security research, or why
                    monospace fonts are objectively the best fonts.
                </p>

                        building CLI tools in Rust. I'm also exploring Docker and container

                        Linux (Arch, btw), Neovim, Rust toolchain, Python with PyTorch/CUDA,
                        Git, Docker, and far too many terminal tabs. My shell is
                        meticulously customized — I spend more time on my dotfiles than I'd
                        like to admit.
